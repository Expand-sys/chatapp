# chatapp
Chat application with integration to discord for webpages. mainly for my own business use but can be adapted to work with anyones setup. I may make it more complex in terms of functionality or less complex for people using it if they need.

all variables are controlled with .env

required variables:
`TOKEN={discordbot token}`
`THREADCHANNEL={Channel id that you want the bot to create threads in}`
`MODEROLE={Moderator role to pick person from to add to the chat}`
